===========

Get all 4k+ songs from web Archive with this little script.

I mean, this site -> tinyurl.com/otwgkp2

Created in october 2013., listened to 200 of them. Some are trash, some are really good.
Can I collect them, I mean, listen to them all by the end of 2014.?
You sure try.

Help:
You'll have to start the script in python 2.7.5 shell. 

It takes the links from file "mp3links.txt" and starts downloading.

When first song is finished downloading, it will output you a line of the song 
that's been downloaded + name of the song. Then go to the second line, etc...

If in any way, script stops, you'll know where it stopped so you can just
delete all the downloaded lines from "mp3links.txt" (don't forget to remove blank lines,
the script will stop in case there is a blank line that's next on the list to download) and 
start the script again.
